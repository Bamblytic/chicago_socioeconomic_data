# # Coursera SQL and Python Final Project

This Jupyter notebook presents a comprehensive final project integrating SQL and Python for data analysis, using real-world datasets primarily focused on Chicago public data.

## Overview

- Installation and setup of required packages including pandas, ipython-sql, and prettytable.
- Connection to a SQLite database to run SQL queries within the notebook using magic commands.
- Analysis of Chicago Census data, Public Schools data, and Crime data with detailed querying and visualization.
- Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation using a combination of SQL and Python.
- Insightful data summaries and interpretations for schooling, crime, and demographic trends.

## Features

- Executes complex SQL queries across multiple datasets.
- Data visualization and tabulation using pandas and prettytable.
- Demonstrates seamless Python and SQL integration in Jupyter notebooks.
- Facilitates data-driven decision-making through comprehensive exploratory analyses.

## Usage

1. Ensure a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook is set up.
2. Install dependencies with `pip install pandas ipython-sql prettytable`.
3. Open `Coursera-sql-and-python-final-project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run cells sequentially to explore data and analyses.
5. Modify SQL queries or Python code to fit custom datasets or analysis goals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Packages: pandas, ipython-sql, prettytable, sqlite3 (standard library)
